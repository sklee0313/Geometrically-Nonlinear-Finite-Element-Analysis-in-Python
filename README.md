# Geometrically-Nonlinear-Finite-Element-Analysis-with-Python

Geometrically nonlinear finite element analyses are presented in Python.  

Available examples are:  

1. **Slender Beam Bending Example**  
   A two-dimensional slender beam is subject to a point force that creates bending-type large displacements.  
   The 8-node quadrilateral element is used to model the bending effectively, and the Total Lagrangian formulation is employed.  
   The problem is solved in [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/0045-7949(77)90027-X) and [here](https://doi.org/10.1108/EC-10-2019-0478).
